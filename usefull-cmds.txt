# vim: jump to the definition
# user gd or ctrl + ]

# vim: choose the option in intellisense 
# user ctrl + p to go up and ctrl + n to go down  

# VERY VERY USEFULL
# Vim: alternate file
# which is an ability to go to the previous file that you have came from
# ctrl + 6

# source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQfFvExpZDU
# Vim: if a line is so long that j skips the below line and goes pass that
# you can use gj to go down or gk to go up
# if you want to break that line easily you can do
# gq q and vim breaks that line into multiple lines

# vim: if you substitude something with
# :s/[search term]/[replace-with]/g
# which the above command will run that for the line which the cursor is on
# but if you do the g& it will run that command for the entire document

# vim: if you use the * to go to a occurence of a word or use
# the / to search for that then you can use the cgn to change that word 
# and then for the  next occurence of that word  you can use the . 
# to repeat all of the above

# HOW TO INC/DEC screen light
# dont forget that you have installed the light package
# use the light -h for more info
# and you have set the lightup, lightdown aliases to
# increase/decrease the light by 10%
# dont forget to use the sudo to increase or decrease light
# ex: 
$ sudo light -A 10 # which increases the light by 10%
$ sudo light -U 10 # which decreases the light by 10%
# DONT FORGET: that you have set some aliases like 'lightup' 'lightdown'

# HOW TO INC/DEC sound/volume
# ex:
$ amixer set 'Master' 50% # set the volume 50% of the max
$ amixer set 'Master' 10%+ # increases the sound 10% more
$ amixer set 'Master' 10%- # decreases the sound 10% less
# DONT FORGET: that you have set some aliases like 'soundup' 'sounddown'


# HOW TO CHANGE LANGUAGE
# commands are added at the end of .bashrc file
#  use the menu button to toggle
# menu button is the button next to the right win key

# DONT FORGET:
# that you have installed the autocannon npm package
# that can http load test your site and for benchmarking

# get the total number of commits (the difference) from master branch
$ git log --oneline [branch name] ^master | wc -l

# show the git log in color ful and short way:
$ git log --pretty=format:"%C(red)%h %c(blue)%an %C(white)%s"
# %h = hash, %an = author name, %s = subject of the commit

# Dont forget that you have set the bellow command:
$ cdp # which goes to the projects/shop

# Dont forget that you have change the $mod+d -> $mod+i in i3
# and the i3 config file is at ~/.config/i3/config

# ls command:
$ ls -1 # means one entry per line and if you send the result of
# ls to a file this is the default behavior but not in terminal
$ ls -R # recursively show all sub dirs
$ ls -R1 # you can combine the last two commands
$ ls -a # shows the hidden files and dirs
$ ls -l # shows more info
$ ls -r # shows files and dirs in reverse order

# Dont forget that you have changed the i3(linux): 
## full screen to mod+a instead of mod+f
## cause you wanted to use the alt+f instead of ctrl+b in tmux

# Tmux commands:
# alt+f n -> rotates the open panes
# alt+f l -> toggles the panes
# alt+f :kill-session -> kills the session
# alt+f d -> detaches the session
# $ tmux ls -> lists all of the active sessions
# $ tmux attach -t [session number from prev command] attaches to that session
# alt+f 0 -> goes to 0 pane
# alt+f % -> opens a new pane horizontaly
# alt+f c -> create new pane
# alt+f " -> opens a new pane verticaly
# alt+f x -> closes the current pane
# alt+f & -> closes the current window
# ctrl+d -> to close a window

# To see which program is using particular port
$ sudo netstat -nlp | grep 4000 # this will return the process using the port 4000

# git:

$ git reset

# Dont forget about p in VIM:
# for eample dip will delete the whole paragaraph which cursor is in middle of
# or ofcourse cip

# DONT FORGET in VIM:
# if in a function body you can go to the { by pressing [{ in normal mode
# this will jump the cursor to the first enclosing {
# and you cant jump to the end by ]}

# in VIM '' toggle between two jumps
# in VIM zz centers the cursor
# in VIM zb cursor will be at bottom of screen
# in VIM zt cursor will be at top of screen

# IN VIM *** IMPORTANT *** with ^ go the first letter in current line 
# instead of using 0w

# in VIM use [] and ][ to jump between end of curlies like }

# in VIM dont forget [m to jump to {
# if { is first character of its line you can use [[
# and you cant use ]m to go to the }

# in VSCODE VIM Dont forget that you cant use ctrl+j and ctrl+k to move the content of current line up and down
# you did setup this in settings.json
# in vscode this was done by alt+ up and down arrows

# in vscode vim: you cant scroll up and down without moving the cursor by using ctrl+y and ctrl+e

# in vscode vim dont forget: that you can use zc to fold a function and zo to open the folded function body
# or you cant za to toggle the folding

# In Terminal we have:
$ ls -S # (captial S)  sorts ths result by file size
# if you want to see the file size in human readable format
$ ls -sh # lower case s and -h for the human readable
# bellow command will give you the name of file with the biggest size
$ ls -S | head -1

# DONT FORGET IN CSS 
# you can stretch to the remaing space in flex using
# flexGrow: 1
# in grid you have to do
# gridTemplateRows: "min-content auto min-content"
# gridTemplateColumns: "1fr"

# Problem:: VSCODE freezes when you switch from chrome or another program to it
# FIX: rm -rf ~/.config/Code
# see also: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/28709#issuecomment-308487766
# that files gets big as the times goes on delete it and vscode becomes fast again

# VIM: how to delete an entire function if your cursor is inside of a function:
va{V # which means select around curly brace then select the whole line (thats why we use capital V to select the function signature as well)

# VIM: remeber to use the :s/$/bar in vim
# which if you select a few lines and do that, that will add a bar end of all of the selection, $ means end of the line, s means substitude

# VIM ::: DONT FORGET ::::
# that you can increment the number in a line with ctrl+a
# if you want to incremenet a selection of lines for examples indexes of an array
# first select them then you can do: g ctrl+a

# DONT forget in google chrome you can search between tabs by:
# Ctrl + Shift + A -> then type the name of the tab it is fuzzy finder

# HOW TO: know if a program is using a port:
# Or when nodejs server stucks on using port for example 3000 how to close it:
$ lsof -i tcp:3000
# then you can 
$ kill -9 PID

# Dont forget that you have installed n package for updating and installing nodejs
# example:
$ sudo n latest # will update/install nodejs to the latest version

# Dont forget that you have clip alias in your .bashrc file
# clip is alias to $ xclip -sel c # which sends the output to the clipboard so you can later on paste from clipboard
# example: 
$ ls | grep someSearchText | clip
# then paste it in terminal with ctrl + shift + v

# Dont forget that the neovim config is in ~/.config/nvim/

# Dont forget in VSCode vim that in visual mode you can past yanked item with <leader>p
# This way paste register will  still have the item you want so later you can to p to past
# see more in vscode user settings.json

# Dont forget about the top command in linux
# you can use it to see the running process
# if you want to filter a process just press o then type COMMAND=npm run dev
# will show the $npm run dev process and if you want to clear all the filters
# press =

# when you get the error that git cannot install (connection refuesed or error or something like this)
# this is because of https_proxy if you type $echo https_proxy it will show that
# to fix: you need to type $unset https_proxy and $unset HTTPS_PROXY
